<h1>HTML Tables Cheatsheet</h1>
<p>
  The first coding project that I completed!
  <br>
  <br>
  I am currently learning how to code and to practice what I  learned so far, I attempted to complete this project (which is part of a coding course that I am undertaking).
  <br>
  <br>
  In this project, I made a cheatsheet explaining which HTML tags are used to create tables, their roles and how CSS is used to style table elements.<br>
  
  Feel free to have a look at my project and share your thoughts!
  <br>
  <br>
  Any feedback or advice will be greatly appreciated!
